The resolution? Well that’s not even close, with 8 K sensors out on RED and Alexa cameras. That said film is where cinema started and to suggest otherwise is not only disingenuous, but leads us to believe there is not an amazing quality to film (there is).  This history and aesthetics of film is are so important that Christopher Nolan, J.J. Abrahms, Quentin Tarantino, and Martin Scorsese essentially forced in 2014, through the power of celebrity, all six major Hollywood studios to buy a specific undisclosed amount of Kodak Film Stock per year, forever, to keep that part of the film industry’s history alive. Kodak CEO Jeff Clarke has said “With the support of the studios, we will continue to provide motion picture film, with its unparalleled richness and unique textures, to enable filmmakers to tell stories and demonstrate their art.”  Tarantino sees the advent of Digital as the fall of films as he once knew them. He eloquated his opinion with usual passion when he said “The magic of movies is connected to 35 mm.  Everyone thinks, you cant help but think, that when you are filming something on film that you are recording movement, you’re not recording movement you are just taking a series of still pictures.  There’s no movement in movies at all. They are still pictures, but when shown at 24 frame a second, through a lightbulb, it creates the illusion of movement. So thus, as opposed to a recording device, when you’re watching a movie, a film print, you are watching an illusion.  And to me that illusion is connected to the magic of movies”.  From the above quote it seems to me that though the master Director understands his art, he does not understand technology.  One still, when shooting a raw format, ends up with 24 individual still pictures per second. This is true whether shooting Alexa, RED, Black Magic Design, or Sony.  One still must choose their shutter angle (shutter speed), frame rate, and ISO therefore there is no technical difference between film and digital.  None whatsoever, and to argue that simply stems from a lack of knowledge (and that’s okay since he is a master at celluloid and has not really tried Digital, except one time many years with Robert Rodriguez… how Robert convinced him is the stuff of legend).</p><picture>
